You are provided with 3 grids, each of them is 5x5 in size.
Empty cells are marked with "â–¢" and filled cells are marked with "X".
The first grid is always the target grid and other 2 are distractor grids.

Goal:
    Your task is to generate a referring expression that best describes the target grid and distinguishes it from other distractor grids.

Rules:
    (a) Your response must follow the structure: "REASON: <some text> \nEXPRESSION: <some text>".
    (b) Think step-by-step. Explain your reasoning under "REASON: <some text>" before generating the final expression under "EXPRESSION: <some text>".
