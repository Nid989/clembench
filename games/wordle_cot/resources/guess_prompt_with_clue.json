You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). \n\nYour response should follow the JSON schema given below.\n{\n\"Let's think step by step\": \"reasoning why selecting a guess word for the current interaction.\",\n\"GUESS\": \"A five letters guess word.\"\n}\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\n{\n\"Let's think step by step\": \"In the fairy tale Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\",\n\"GUESS\": \"apple\"\n}\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe reasoning should be short and concise. It could contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nDo not generate anything else except for the JSON output. \n\nLet's begin with your first guess."
